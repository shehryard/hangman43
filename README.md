# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Project description:
The aim of this project is to replicate the hangman game using the python programming language. This will enable me to consolidate my learning and put the lessons learnt into practical use. In addition to this, I will also gain exposure to using VSCode and Github for projects.

File structure:
milestone 2 -> milestone 3 -> milestone 4 -> milestone 5.
The milestones contain continous improvement to the code and structure whilst implementing more functionality.
Milestone 2: Created the variables for the game
Milestone 3: Defined the functions and made sure the code looks neat. Contains code to check if the guessed letter is in the word.
Milestone 4: The game class 'Hangman' was created using OOP concepts. The code added provides functionality for what will happen if the guessed letter is in the word, and if the guessed letter is not in the word.
