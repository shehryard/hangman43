# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Project description:
The aim of this project is to replicate the hangman game using the python programming language. This will enable me to consolidate my learning and put the lessons learnt into practical use. In addition to this, I will also gain exposure to using VSCode and Github for projects.
